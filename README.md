## Hello there
Jija is a new async web framework for python.
It is based on aiohttp.
It takes a lot of good things from django and fastapi and combines them in one framework.

## Why was jija created?
There are no good async frameworks for python.
I wanted to create a framework that would be easy to use like django and can work with async like fastapi.
I also wanted to create a framework that would be easy to learn, 
and it can use any elements of the different libs that will be included by driver.

## Documentation
You can find documentation [here](https://jija.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
