## Swagger
Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.
With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting 
    Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment.
Swagger is also the only open specification that uses JSON / YAML to describe the RESTful API,
    allowing easy integration with automated documentation, code generation and test-case generation.

???+ warning
    This driver is included in jija by default, but in next updates it will be moved to separate package.

For more details check [Swagger](/manual/docs).
